# Goldilox_API_Layer

This repo is specifically for testing out API concepts for a peer-to-peer API network.

The focus is on figuring out the differences in terms of performance and network structure between
high performance apps (a raytracer) and low to medium performance apps (integrating a Java application with a
Python application across a network).

### This design is probably trash so use anything here at your own rist
